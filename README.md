1. In our UML diagram, should Task be a class or should it simply be a string?  Why or why not?
When looking at the UML diagram, it seems like there could be multiple things added to one task and therefore it would be useful to have task be a class instead of a string. If it were a string, and there were multiple things needed to be done under one class, then the string would need to be parsed and that seems more messy and less applicable than a class implementation.
2. What future enhancements might you add to this project next?  Does the answer to this question change your answer to the first question?  
We would make task_name become a class object with different properties (things to be done) for that particular task. 
Something we could add would be to implement the ability to add a particular thing to be done with a task that already exists. Another thing in relation to this would be to delete something that has been done, but the entire task has not been completed yet. 
No, it does not change our answer, it makes our reasoning even more strong because of the ability to delete or add new pieces of the class.
